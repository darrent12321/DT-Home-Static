                <h3>First steps...</h3>
                <p>After a few years in Desktop Support I finally have some time to learn some web technologies and thought it a good idea to share some of my journey.<br>
                    Starting with this basic blog I will be running through different lessons from various sources and as I build on my knowledge I build up my portfolio.<br>
                    This blog doesn't reflect everything I have learned as many lessons do not end up with any sort of artifact that can be presented here, CodingGame.com being a prime example.<br>
                    Sources will include YouTube, books and various websites. If I can remember I will give credit where it is due.<br>
                    A big thank you to all those that put their own time in to create lessons and other content for everyone. It's very much appreciated.<br>
                    Please bear in mind that a lot of the content will be half baked rubbish, but as long as I learn a lesson at least I will be happy!

                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                <p>Well compared to CSS, Javascript is much more intuitive! Read through the basic <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> tutorials
                    first then went onto Ania Kub&oacutews <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w/"
                    target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel to go through a few of the Javascript tutorials. I followed
                    along and built a few of the games, with the intention of adding a few bits of my own to them. This
                    led me to a deeper investigation of Javascript timers and the DOM and then further wrestling with
                    CSS! <br>For my Javascript efforts see <a href="js.html">here</a>. I only had time to style
                    the <a href="Ania/Flappy/index.html">Flappy Birds</a> game, but this is something I intend to come
                    back to every now and then to brush up on both my Javascript and CSS skills.</p>

                <h3>CSS is so easy! HAIYAA!</h3>
                <p>Well the basics look easy enough, but once you get into things it seems to get complicated very
                    quickly! Maybe the initial simplicity was my downfall and I think that it led me into a false sense
                    of security. With other languages it seems that you can get a lot done with just the basics then
                    build as needed, but with CSS I feel like I'm reading articles and following tutorials for the
                    simplest thing! OK so I just want an image to fit in that div, without overflowing, chopping bits
                    off or adding borders. Then I want some text to the left and want it all to resize nicely. Sounds
                    easy right?
                    <br>The frustrating thing is that a lot of CSS properties have an effect for the parent and the
                    child, but most of the tutorials only focus on one or the other. Also many CSS properties are
                    shortcuts and apply defaults, such as display: flex, which lays out how the container operates plus
                    sets 3 properties for the children.
                    <br>Well I fought the battle and the homepage now has a photo of me on it! I like the extra colour
                    it brings, but still not sure about that photo!

                <h3>Blog Post #1 - Basic Home Page First Draft!</h3>
                <p>So! My first ever blog post!</p>
                <p>This blog post doesn't really need to say much as it is best explained by this actual page itself.
                    Thanks to Timothy Unkert for the YouTube lesson <a href="https://youtu.be/YCaUBFZw_uo"
                        target="_blank">Building a blog in html and css</a>. Thanks also for opening my eyes to Visual
                    Studio Code and Emmet!
                    <br>I wanted to start with some basic html and css. No frills, just basic stuff so I can understand
                    whats going on. I'm going to build on this in later lessons, so this initial page will be pretty
                    dull!
                </p>
                <p>If you are visiting this page from the future, the original draft #1 can actually be found <a
