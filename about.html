            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Well I wanted a menu and so created this About Me page!</p>
            <p>After a few years in Desktop Support I finally have some time to learn some web technologies and thought it a good idea to share some of my journey.
                Starting with this basic blog I will be running through different lessons from various sources and as I
                build on my knowledge I build up my portfolio.</p>
            <p>This blog doesn't reflect everything I have learned as many lessons do not end up with any sort of
                artifact that can be presented here, CodingGame.com being a prime example.</p>
            <p>Sources will include YouTube, books and various websites. If I can remember I will give credit where
                it is due.</p>
            <p>A big thank you to all those that put their own time in to create lessons and other content for everyone.
                It's very much appreciated.</p>
            <p>Please bear in mind that some of the examples will be half baked rubbish, but as long as I learn a lesson
                at least I will be happy!</p>
